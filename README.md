# CCT-Compact-Convlutional-Transformer
a PyTorch implementation of "Escaping the Big Data Paradigm with Compact Transformers"

the result on CIFAR 10 will be added soon! :))

I made a big mistake that RELU function had been added into the convolution phase, I will remove it and RETEST the performance!!!!!!!!!!!!!
